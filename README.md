# Project 2 - Definitely Not Megaman
	This is a project made for the Advanced Programming class. The project consists of a game which tries to imitate MegaMan but isn't really Megaman. We use Megaman's main character as something fun and we implemented more levels and a boss as well. The best way to see what this is all about is to try it for yourself!	

	Estimated Time spent: 50

- [x] Boss health bar on top of boss.

- [ ] Adding more levels.
- [ ] Make the boss move more realistic.
- [ ] Add multiple moving platforms that would lead to a platform that had a shield powerup.

## Notes


Our biggest challenge was to make the boss and the moving platforms since we weren't sure how we could approach it and make it have a health bar as well.

Our favorite part has to be the boss because even though it was hard thinking how we could approach it, it was fun coding it and the experience of trying to find something unique to add as a boss.
